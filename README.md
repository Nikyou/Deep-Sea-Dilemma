# Deep Sea Dilemma
Deep Sea Dilemma presents an exciting puzzle game that not only enhances your logical thinking but also provides ample entertainment. In this game, you take control of a captain (or two if you prefer playing against another player) who embarks on a perilous journey across deep seas in search of an enigmatic treasure. However, there's a twist: a warning has been issued that the treasure carries a deadly curse, destined to claim the life of the first person to find it. The other captain is also aware of this ominous fact, but time is running out. If you were to ignore the treasure, your crew would fail to comprehend the situation. Therefore, you hatch a plan.

According to the rules, the captain on watch always reaches the treasure first. Consequently, you strive to orchestrate circumstances in such a way that the other captain is on watch when you finally arrive at the treasure's location. Each passing day necessitates your steady progression towards the treasure to prevent any potential mutiny from your crew. It's a battle of wits to determine the most cunning and intelligent captain.

Deep Sea Dilemma offers an extensive gameplay experience comprising nine levels of varying difficulties, alongside an informative tutorial. Upon successfully completing each level against the CPU (AI), you earn gold that can be spent in the in-game shop to customize your ship's appearance and map. Each level presents a grid-based scenario, allowing your ship to move horizontally or vertically up to its designated speed, while diagonal movements are prohibited. Although you must approach the goal with each turn, you have the freedom to decide whether to utilize your ship's maximum speed or not. Along the map, you encounter two types of obstacles: rocks and vortices. Rocks act as physical barriers, impeding the ship's movement, while vortices halt the ship's progress if it passes through them, subsequently ending the current turn.
